title: We are hooked on Distraction
---
In my last post on Loneliness, I briefly went over the fact that human beings cannot simply be by themselves. We need something, some form of entertainment, or someone to help us ignore the emptiness of our lives. Most of us live our lives guided by societal norms which more or less looks like a task list given below (Indian perspective):

  - go to school/be good at science,
  - get an engineering/medical degree, 
  - get a job/build a successful career,
  - BE A MAN/WOMAN! 
  - marry/start a family, 
  - raise kids, 
  - retirement thing,
  - and finallyâ€¦ die!. 

Now, this is an amazing task list. It will take an entire lifetime to complete and we will never have to face the nothingness of life. We are, at some level aware that someday, we will be no more and we will at some point in time, no longer matter. We were created out of nothing and will go back to being nothing. What we accomplish during our lifetime, you know, like being the gold medalist or sleeping with hot chicks or getting that big fat cheque or being the president of XYZ country - everything will be forgotten with time. At the end of the day, it's just a fleeting moment of satisfaction for which we work our asses off. The very next moment, our brain goes like "Bro... what next?" -- this is the emptiness of life. 

We need something to get through our day. The inherent scream of silence and idleness isn't something we are used to. The effect of which was felt during the initial lockdowns due to COVID-19 pandemic. People were shut inside their houses and for the first time and had nothing to do (Exception: Software Engineers -- who are working from home 24x7). Many people were lost in the vicious circle of negative thoughts and depression as flagged by medical experts. Human beings cannot do nothing since it brings their lives to an abrupt standstill and that is a very uncomfortable feeling.

Most of us are operating in the autopilot mode - I feel - we are running behind things we do not know if we really want. We are unaware of things happening within and around us. We just go on answering the "What next?" call and keep the machine running. For the machine must not discover it is a human!

When we are alone with nothing to do (also, no internet or any digital gadget), we are left with the most raw form of us. That can be scary, since most of us have no fucking idea of who we are. We are scared to look inside since we don't know what we might find in there. We don't know if society will approve of such a person. So, Instead, we just focus on completing the task list and bury our true selves deep inside of us.

Self-awareness, on the other hand, takes us a long way ahead. It helps us, to know us, to take care of ourselves, to have a sense of purpose, build a task list suited for us, and form better relationships with people who matter. It's the best package :).
